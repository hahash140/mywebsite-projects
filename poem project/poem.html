    <h1>Life</h1>
    <p>
      For years we have striven
      <br />
      The wonderous goal to gain
      <br />
      To be a senior
      <br />
      By dint of might and main
    </p>
    <p>
      The path of life leads onwards
      <br />
      To realms unknown
      <br />
      Let us follow our loved ones upwards
      <br />
      Until in knowledge we are grown
    </p>
    <p>
      Memories, the essence of life
      <br />
      of which we must keep
      <br />
      And we will strive
      <br />
      When the hills get steep.
